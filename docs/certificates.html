                    The course "PHP Web Development Basics" introduces the fundamentals of
                    programming and the features in PHP language and its syntax. The basic principles of web programming
                    (HTTP protocol, Apache web server configuration and PHP configuration), syntax of the language
                    (scripts, variables, conditional constructs, cycles), HTML forms and user data processing, work with arrays
                    (traditional and associative), strings and word processing, and others. The course ends with a practical
                    PHP programming and project development exam.</p>
